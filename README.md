This repository contains all of the code and software labs for CSCI410: Introduction to Machine Learning.

## Opening the labs in Google Colaboratory:

The 2021 CSCI410 labs will be run in Google's Colaboratory, a Jupyter notebook environment that runs entirely in the cloud, you don't need to download anything. To run these labs, you must have a Google account.

On this Github repo, navigate to the lab folder you want to run the lab and open the appropriate python notebook (\*.ipynb). Click the "Run in Colab" link on the top of the lab. That's it!

## Running the labs
Now, to run the labs, open the Jupyter notebook on Colab. Navigate to the "Runtime" tab --> "Change runtime type". In the pop-up window, under "Runtime type" select "Python 3", and under "Hardware accelerator" select "GPU". Go through the notebooks and fill in the `#TODO` cells to get the code to compile for yourself!
